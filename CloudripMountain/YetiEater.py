# Yetis surround us and we need to defeat them.
# Luckily the wizard had time to cast the sleep spell.
# Your hero can devour the yetis' vital powers when they are defeated.
# Defeat them in the order from weakest to the strongest.

# The wizard sorted enemies, but in the order from the strongest to the weakest.

# You need iterate the yetis list in the reverse order with a 'for-loop'.
# The start value should be 'len(yetis) - 1'.
# Iterate while the index greater than -1.
# Use the negative step -1.
index = len(yetis)-1
while index>=0:
    # Attack each enemy while its health greater than 0.
    while yetis[index].health>0:
