bottomLeft = corners.bottomLeft

# Calculate the size of the garden.
width = topRight.x - bottomLeft.x
height = topRight.y - bottomLeft.y
# Find the perimeter of the garden (meters):
perimeter = (width+height)*2
# Use fencePrice and calculate the fence cost:
fenceCost = fencePrice * perimeter
# Find the area of the garden (square meters):
area = width*height
# Use lawnPrice and calculate the lawn cost:
lawnCost = area * lawnPrice

# The total cost is the sum of the fence and the lawn costs
totalCost = fenceCost + lawnCost # Î” Update this with the final price!
